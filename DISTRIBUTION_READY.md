# EverGreen - Distribution Package Ready

## ✅ What You Have

I have successfully created a **complete, working distribution package** for your client:

**File Location:** `d:\EverGreen\EverGreen-Complete.zip` (approximately 183 MB)

## 📦 How to Share with Your Client

1. **Send them the file:** `EverGreen-Complete.zip`
2. **Client Instructions:**
   - Extract the ZIP file to any location (e.g., `C:\EverGreen`)
   - Open the extracted folder
   - **Double-click `START_EVERGREEN.bat`** to launch the application
   - Alternatively, run `EverGreen.exe` directly

## 🔐 Login Credentials

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `password123`

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: If Login Fails
If you have run a previous version of the app, your old database might be cached. To fix this:
1. Close the app.
2. Go to `%APPDATA%` (type it in Windows search).
3. Delete the `EverGreen` folder.
4. Restart the app.

## 💾 Database & Data Storage

- **Database Location:** Automatically created in `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\EverGreen\database.db`
- **Completely Offline:** No internet required after installation
- **All data is stored locally** on the client's computer
- **Automatic Initialization:** Database is created on first run with default admin user

## 📋 What's Included

- ✅ Complete EverGreen application
- ✅ Backend API (runs automatically)
- ✅ SQLite database (auto-initialized)
- ✅ All dependencies bundled
- ✅ Works completely offline

## 🎯 Key Features for Client

1. **Portable:** Can be moved to any folder
2. **No Installation Required:** Just extract and run
3. **Self-Contained:** Everything needed is included
4. **Data Persistence:** All data saved locally
5. **Multi-User:** Support for multiple user accounts with role-based access

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Keep all files together:** Don't separate files from the folder
- **Antivirus:** Some antivirus software may flag the .exe initially (false positive) - this is normal for Electron apps
- **Updates:** To update, simply replace the folder with a new version (database in AppData remains intact)

## 🔄 If You Need a Professional Installer (Optional)

The current package is a **portable version** (extract and run). If you need a professional installer that:
- Creates Start Menu shortcuts
- Adds to Programs & Features
- Provides uninstall option

You must run the build script as **Administrator**:
1. Open PowerShell/CMD as Administrator
2. Navigate to `d:\EverGreen`
3. Run: `node build-desktop.js`
4. The installer will be created as `apps\desktop\dist\EverGreen Setup 1.0.0.exe`
